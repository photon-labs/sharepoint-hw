    <!-- Solution path - this tells WSP builder to step back one level for the master (startup/build) project to the main 'wsp solution'

folder, and build all projects within that folder to one wsp (cab). By default this wsp will take the name of the folder it sits

in, or use the WSPName key (see below) to give your own name. Unfortunately this dictates a rigid project folder structure, so it

is advised that projects used in more than one wsp solution solutions are subsequently 'referenced/linked' in source control to

match this client build structure rather than physically copied. They can then be 'project referenced' in Visual Studio, which

leaves the option of branching them completely if required. Although this promotes re-use, care should be taken as it often

indicates a new wsp is required to prevent inadvertent upgrades or clashes with already installed features in other solutions.

If it is a variation, consider branching or copying files (especially feature.xml to ensure guid is used), dll referencing of base

feature and inheritance. -->
